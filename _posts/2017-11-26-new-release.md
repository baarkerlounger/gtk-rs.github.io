Hi everyone!

This release was supposed to be a minor one and to be released a lot sooner. However, as the time passed, `gtk-rs` developers weren't happy with what they had. There was always that little (but still wonderful) thing missing that we absolutely wanted to have. Suddenly, huges improvements came in and breaking changes as well. And this, is exactly how you end up from some very little and quickly release to medium and huge one.

So what took us so long to add? A lot of things, the list is quite long. You can check the pull requests below. Let's just focus on the main ones.

First, a small one: the `dox` feature: now, when building documentation, whatever platform you're on or library version you have, you'll be able to generate documentation for **everything** and have access to it locally. So to build your documentation locally, you just need to run:

```
cargo doc --features "dox embed-lgpl-docs"
# this second command removes the generated doc comments from the crate's code
cargo build --features "purge-lgpl-docs"
```

Pretty easy, right?

Now, secondly, [@antoyo](https://github.com/antoyo) added async support. You'll now be able to call API functions without blocking the GUI. You'll also be able to control those with the `Cancellable` type. He also said that he would add the async functions/methods support in [`relm`](https://github.com/antoyo/relm) as soon as possible, no more details in there haha.

Ok, now take a deep breath, the list for [@sdroege](https://github.com/sdroege)'s changes is quite long:

 * `SignalHandlerId` and `SourceId` are now newtype wrappers instead of integers and can't be copy/clone anymore. It prevents to reuse of them or the usage of arbitrary numbers.
 * Arguments in signal trampolines are borrowed now, which prevents some copy and unneeded refcounting.
 * `GHookList` is generated in the -sys bindings.
 * Enums have been updated in order to avoid unwanted soundless bugs appearing in case of C API update between two versions.
 * Emitter functions for action signals are now generated.
 * Panics from signal callbacks print something meaningful now instead of just exiting silently.
 * Various new impls for the translation traits to make everything more complete.
 * `ObjectExt::set_value()` / `emit()` now take a &ToValue instead of Value, making it easier to use.
 * `Closure::invoke()` / `ObjectExt::emit()` don't allocate anything now if the number of arguments is < 10 (it's placed on the heap).
 * Removed implementation of `DerefMut` for `TypedValue`. This allowed to store wrongly typed values inside `TypedValue`, e.g. an `u32` in a `TypedValue<String>`.
 * `Value` is not `Send + Sync` anymore and a `SendValue` that only allows `Send` types to be stored was added. Previously `Value` allowed to store non-`Send` types but could be sent to another thread due to being `Send` itself independent of the content.
 * `IsA` is an unsafe trait now, as otherwise safe code could implement the `IsA` relationship between incompatible types which would result in memory unsafety.
 * Added `AnyValue` / `AnySendValue` that allows storing any Rust value that is `Any + Clone + 'static` to be stored in a `glib::Value`.
 * Added support for storing/retrieving a (NULL-terminated) array of strings in/from `glib::Value`.
 * Added some new API for working with `Type` such `is_a()`, `parent()`, etc...
 * `ObjectExt::connect()` now panics if the callback return value is incompatible with signal's, and allow return values that are a subtype of the signal's return value.

[@Epashkin](https://github.com/EPashkin)'s changes are less visible but just as important. As always, he made of very important fixes, adds and reviews but since they're very [`gir`](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir) specific, I invite you to check them directly into the [`gir`](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir) repository.

Lastly, a little change that'll only impact people using `gtk-rs` sys crates: all sys types now have a `Debug` implementation. We hope it'll make debugging much easier in order to help expanding the `gtk-rs` crates environment.

That's it! (Yes, it was quite long.)

Hope you'll enjoy this new version and see you next time!
