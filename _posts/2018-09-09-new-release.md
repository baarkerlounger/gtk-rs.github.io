---

After being rescheduled a few times, the new `gtk-rs` is finally here! This time, we focused on adding new types, doing some cleanups and fixing a few things. But the big thing of this release is the add of [futures](https://crates.io/crates/futures-preview) to handle asynchronous function calls! If you're interested into this, you should take a look at the examples:

 * [gio_futures](https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples/blob/pending/src/bin/gio_futures.rs)
 * [gio_features_await](https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples/blob/pending/src/bin/gio_futures_await.rs)

Have fun hacking!
