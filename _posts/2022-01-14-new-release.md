Hi everyone! Happy new year!

With this new year comes a new [gtk-rs][gtk-rs] release! As usual, a lot of improvements have been made. Let's check them out!

One important change: the minimum supported rust version is now **1.56**.

### Minimum and latest supported versions of the underlying C libraries

The minimum supported versions of the underlying C libraries have not changed compared to last release but support for newer versions was added:

 * GLib/GObject/GIO: minimum 2.48, latest 2.72
 * Pango/PangoCairo: minimum 1.38, latest 1.52
 * gdk-pixbuf: minimum 2.32, latest 2.42
 * cairo: minimum 1.14, latest 1.16
 * graphene: minimum 1.10
 * ATK: minimum 2.18, latest 2.38
 * GTK3: minimum 3.18, latest, 3.24.9
 * GTK4: minimum 4.0, latest 4.6

### Changes to derive macro names

All [derive](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/index.html#derives) and [attribute](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/index.html#attributes) macros are named more consistently now. Instead of e.g. `glib::GBoxed`, the new name is just `glib::Boxed` and misses the additional `G`, which would be redundant namespacing.

### GLib Variant API improvements and derive macro

The [`glib::Variant`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/variant/struct.Variant.html) API was improved a lot in this release. `Variant` is a type that allows to store structured data built from basic types in a way that can be serialized into binary data efficiently.

A lot of API that was missing in previous releases was added, including API for efficient conversion from/to slices of basic types, strings and other container types. The existing conversion APIs were optimized and cleaned up.

To make it easier to handle custom structs (and soon [enums](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/pull/434)), a [derive macro](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/derive.Variant.html) was added that allows to directly convert between a custom Rust type and a `Variant` and back.

```rust
use glib::prelude::*;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, glib::Variant)]
struct Foo {
    some_string: String,
    some_int: i32,
}

let v = Foo { some_string: String::from("bar"), some_int: 1 };
let var = v.to_variant();
assert_eq!(var.get::<Foo>(), Some(v));
```

By using the derive macro, structured data can be handled automatically instead of manually accessing each of the individual parts of the data. This can be helpful for sending structured data over DBus via the `gio` DBus API, or for dealing with [`gio::Settings`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/gio/struct.Settings.html) or for more complex states/values used in [`gio::Action`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/gio/struct.Action.html).

### Stack allocated types and reducing heap allocations

Various types that are usually stack-allocated in C were previously heap-allocated in the Rust bindings. With this release, these values are also stack-allocated when used from Rust unless explicitly heap-allocated, e.g. by explicitly placing them into a `Box`.

Examples for this are all the [`graphene`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/graphene/index.html) types (vectors, matrices, etc), which should make calculations considerably more efficient, types like [`gdk::Rectangle`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/0.4/docs/gdk4/struct.Rectangle.html) and [`gdk::RGBA`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/0.4/docs/gdk4/struct.RGBA.html), and [`gtk::TreeIter`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/0.4/docs/gtk4/struct.TreeIter.html).

Overall this brings performance of applications using the Rust bindings even closer to the same code in C.

### Main context API improvements

When spawning non-`Send` [futures](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.spawn_local) or [closures](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.invoke_local), or attaching the main context [channel](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.Receiver.html#method.attach) to the [`glib::MainContext`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html), it is not necessary anymore to have the main context acquired before. This was a common cause of confusion and this constraint was relaxed now. Instead it is only required that that thread default main context is not owned by a different thread yet, and if ownership is moved to a different thread at some point then it will panic at runtime.

Additionally the API for pushing a main context as the [thread default](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.with_thread_default) was refactored to reduce the risk of misusage. Instead of returning a guard value, it can only be used via a closure now to ensure proper nesting of thread default main contexts.

```rust
let ctx = glib::MainContext::new();
ctx.with_thread_default(|| {
    // do something with `ctx` being the thread default main context.
}).expect("Main context already owned by another thread");
```

### GLib string builder

`glib::String` was renamed to [`glib::GStringBuilder`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/git/docs/glib/struct.GStringBuilder.html) to avoid confusion with `glib::GString` and to make it clearer that this is meant for building `NUL`-terminated C strings.

In addition the API was simplified considerably:
 * All APIs that allowed to create invalid UTF-8 were removed, leaving only safe APIs to build UTF-8 strings.
 * `GStringBuilder` directly dereferences into `&str`, so all `&str` API can be used on it.
 * `GStringBuilder` implements the `std::fmt::Write` trait, which allows making use of various `std` Rust API. For example `write!(&mut builder, "some format string {}", some_value)` can be used directly to write formatted strings into the string builder.

### Multiple improvements on `glib::ObjectExt`

 - `ObjectExt::property` now return the type T directly instead of a `glib::Value` and panics in case the property is not readable or the wrong type is provided. 
 - `ObjectExt::set_property` now panics in case the property is not writeable or doesn't exists
 - `ObjectExt::emit_by_name` expects you to pass in the type T for the returned value by the signal. If the signal doesn't return anything, you can use `some_obj.emit_by_name::<()>("some_signal", &[]);`  and also panics if the signal doesn't exists.

**Before**:

```rust
object.property("some_property").unwrap().get::<T>().unwrap();
object.set_property("some_property", &some_value).unwrap();
// signal that returns nothing
object.emit_by_name("some_signal").unwrap();
// signal that returns T
let some_value = object.emit_by_name("some_signal").unwrap().unwrap().get::<T>().unwrap();
```

**After**:

```rust
object.property::<T>("some_property");
object.set_property("some_property", &some_value);
object.emit_by_name::<()>("some_signal");
let some_value = object.emit_by_name::<T>("some_signal");
```

A `ObjectExt::try_*` variant exists if you want the old behaviour. As most of the application code unwraps the returned results, this should be one of the slight but nice improvements of the overall API.

### Bindings wrapper types memory representation optimization

All heap-allocated bindings types do now have a memory representation that is equivalent to the underlying raw C pointer. In addition to reducing memory usage compared to before, this also allows for other optimizations and e.g allows to borrow values from C storage in a few places instead of creating copies or increasing their reference count (e.g. in [`glib::PtrSlice`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/collections/struct.PtrSlice.html)).

### GLib collection types

While not used widely yet, a new [`glib::collections`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/collections/index.html) module was added that provides more efficient access to [slices](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/collections/struct.Slice.html), [pointer slices](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/collections/struct.PtrSlice.html) and [linked lists](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/collections/struct.PtrSlice.html) allocated from C. This is similar to the older [`glib::GString`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.GString.html) type, which represents an UTF-8 encoded, `NUL`-terminated C string allocated with the GLib allocator.

Previously (and still for most API), these were converted from/to native Rust types at the FFI boundary, which often caused unnecessary re-allocations and memory copies. In the next release we're trying to move even more API to these new collection types for further performance improvements, and for only doing conversions between Rust and C types when actually necessary.

### Cancelling futures spawned on the GLib main context

[Spawning](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.spawn) futures on the main context now returns the source id. This allows to get access to the underlying [`glib::Source`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.find_source_by_id) and to [cancel](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/struct.Source.html#method.destroy) the future before completion.

Cancelling the future by this, or by other API that drops it (e.g. by selecting on two futures and only processing the first that resolves), will cancel all asynchronous operations performed by them at the next opportunity.

### Dynamic signal connections

A new [`glib::closure`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/macro.closure.html) and [`glib::closure_local`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/macro.closure_local.html) was added that allows to create a [`glib::Closure`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.16/docs/glib/closure/struct.Closure.html) from a Rust closure while automatically unpacking argument [`glib::Value`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/value/struct.Value.html)s to their native Rust types and packing the return value.

While this doesn't sound too exciting, it makes connecting to signals that have no static bindings more convenient.

**Before**:

```rust
obj.connect(
    "notify", false,
    |args| {
        let _obj = args[0].get::<glib::Object>().unwrap();
        let pspec = args[1].get::<glib::ParamSpec>().unwrap();
        println!("property notify: {}", pspec.name());
    });
```

**After**:

```rust
obj.connect_closure(
    "notify", false,
    glib::closure_local!(|_obj: glib::Object, pspec: glib::ParamSpec| {
        println!("property notify: {}", pspec.name());
    }));
```

The macros support the same syntax as the [`glib::clone`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/macro.clone.html) macro for creating strong/weak references, plus a [watch](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/macro.closure.html#object-watching) feature that automatically disconnects the closure once the watched object disappears.

### Object subclassing improvements

`glib::ParamSpecOverride` has now two helper constructors to create an override of a class property or an interface property. For example, overriding the `hadjustment` property of the `gtk::Scrollable` interface can be done with `ParamSpecOverride::for_interface::<gtk::Scrollable>("hadjustment")`.

### Passing Cairo image surfaces to other threads and getting owned access to its data

`Cairo` image surfaces [can now be converted](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/cairo/struct.ImageSurface.html#method.take_data) to an owned value that behaves like an `&mut [u8]` and that can be safely sent to different threads. This allows both sending `Cairo` image surfaces to other threads safely as well as their underlying data, e.g. to fill an image surface from a compressed image via the [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) crate or saving the contents of an image surface to compressed data from a different thread.

```rust
let surface =  cairo::ImageSurface::create(cairo::Format:ARgb32, 320, 240).except("Failed to allocate memory");
// Use Cairo API on the `surface`.
// [...]
let data = surface.take_data().expect("Not the unique owner of the surface");
// Send `data` to another thread or otherwise treat it as a `&mut [u8]`.
// [...]
let surface = data.into_inner();
// Use the `surface` with Cairo APIs again.
```

This solves one of the common problems when using `Cairo` in multi-threaded applications.

### GIO bindings improvements

The gio bindings saw many additions and improvements. Among other things it is now possible to implement the [`gio::Initable`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/gio/struct.Initable.html) interface, the [`gio::IOExtension`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/gio/struct.IOExtension.html) API is now available, and the [`gio::Task`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/gio/struct.Task.html) bindings have been reworked to address soundness issues. More improvements to the `gio::Task` bindings are necessary for them to become nice to use from Rust.

### Gdkwayland

In this release, we generated the bindings for `gdkwayland`. You can now use the brand new [gdkwayland](https://crates.io/crates/gdkwayland) crate!

### GTK3 child properties

The GTK3 bindings had API added for generically [setting](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk3-rs/stable/0.15/docs/gtk/prelude/trait.ContainerExtManual.html#tymethod.child_set_property) and [getting](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk3-rs/stable/0.15/docs/gtk/prelude/trait.ContainerExtManual.html#tymethod.child_property) child properties.

This allows to access child properties for which no static bindings are available and performs all checks at runtime instead of at compile time. The API works the same as the API for [setting](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html#tymethod.set_property) and [getting](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.15/docs/glib/object/trait.ObjectExt.html#tymethod.property) object properties.

### gtk4-rs and `BuilderScope`

The most important feature that landed on this release is a Rust `BuilderScope` implementation thanks to one of the awesome contributions of [@jf2048][@jf2048]. This will allow applications to set callbacks/functions names in the UI file and define those in your Rust code. This only works with the CompositeTemplate macro. See the [documentations](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/docs/gtk4_macros/attr.template_callbacks.html) for how to make use of this new feature.

We also added:

 - Trust upstream return nullability: in other words, [gtk4][gtk4] crates trust the nullable annotations provided in the `GIR` file which replaces a bunch of returned Option and returns only T nowadays. Please open an issue if you find any regressions.
 - GTK 4.6 support, use `v4_6` feature to unlock the new APIs.
 - Functions that return a `glib::Value` have now a corresponding function that gets you inner value `T` directly. Note those will panic if you provide the wrong type.
 - `GtkExpression` helpers to make their usage nicer from Rust:
   ```rust
   let button = gtk::Button::new();
   button.set_label("Label property");

   let label_expression = button.property_expression("label");
   ```
 - A bunch of fixed issues, documentation improvements and new book chapters!
