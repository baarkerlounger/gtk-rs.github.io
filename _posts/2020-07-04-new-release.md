Hi everyone, time for a new release!

Today, it's all about improving APIs and providing the GdkX11 bindings.
Let's see it more in details!

#### Change of minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.40. All the enums provided by the
gtk-rs crates now make use of the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute to indicate
that there might be more values being added in the future.

#### Updated library versions

All the crates were updated to the latest library versions, that is, APIs that
are newly available since GNOME 3.36 are provided by the bindings.

### No more `new_from_...()` and `new_with_...()`

In GLib-based APIs, a common pattern for constructors is to call them
`new_from_...()` or `new_with_...()`. In Rust the `new_` prefix is usually
omitted, so all bindings were changed according to that too.

There might still be a few `new_...()` functions in the bindings. If you find
one and think a different name would be better, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/gtk-rs/glib/issues/new).

#### `glib-macros`

There's a new crate `glib-macros` now, which is re-exported by the `glib`
crate and provides a couple of proc-macros

  * `#[derive(GBoxed)` for easily deriving a boxed type for any Rust type
    the implements the `Clone` trait. This can be used to store values of that
    type in e.g. in `glib::Value`.
  * `#[derive(GEnum)]` for integer representation Rust enums, which registers
    GLib type for them and allows to use them e.g. in a `glib::Value`.
  * `#[gflags]`, which registers a GLib type for bitflags and wraps around the
    `bitflags` crate. Same as above this can then be used e.g. in a
    `glib::Value`.

Check the [documentation](https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib_macros/index.html) for
details about the above.

#### GdkX11

GTK and its companion library GDK provide various API for interoperability
with platform interfaces, like X11 or Wayland or the equivalent APIs on
Windows and macOS.

With this release a crate for the X11 integration API for GDK is included.

### `glib::ThreadPool`

GLib provides a thread-pool API, which is now included in the bindings. There
are many crates that provide similar functionality but nothing that is part of
`std` yet, as such the addition seemed useful unlike adding bindings for the
threading primitives in GLib.

The `ThreadPool` bindings allow to create shared or exclusive thread pools,
where the shared thread pools are sharing their threads with other shared
ones. The maximum number of threads and various other parameters can be
configured on each thread pool, see
the [docs](https://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/struct.ThreadPool.html).

After creation, new tasks can be pushed on the thread pool as a closure.
Optionally a `Future` can be returned to get notified about the completion of
the task.

```rust
let pool = ThreadPool::new_exclusive(1)?;

// Runs `do_something()` on the thread pool and doesn't wait
pool.push(|| {
    do_something();
});

// Runs `do_something_else()` on the thread pool and returns its
// return value via a `Future`
let fut = pool.push_future(|| {
    let res = do_something_else();
    res
});

// Asynchronously await the result of `do_something_else()`
let res = fut.await;
```

### Storage of arbitrary data in `glib::Object`s

In C, GObject provides the ability to store arbitrary data on any object.
Until this release this was not provided by the bindings as it generally is
used as a workaround for a suboptimal architecture, and most importantly
because all type information for the stored data is lost.

In this release `unsafe` API for making use of this is provided but it's the
caller's responsibility to ensure that the types are matching.

```rust
let button = gtk::Button::with_label("test");

unsafe {
    button.set_data("my-data", String::new("my-data-value"));
    let my_data = button.get_data("my-data");
}
```

Before using this please make sure there is no better solution for what you're
trying to achieve.

### `cairo::Error` instead of `cairo::Status`

Previously all `cairo` functions that could fail were returning a `Status`
enum in one way or another. This lead to unidiomatic error handling in Rust
applications.

In this release the `Status` enum was replaced by an `Error` enum that only
includes errors cases and is returned as part of the error case of `Result`s.
This allows doing normal Rust error handling via the `?` operator, for
example.

### cairo features

The `FreeType` and `script` features of the `cairo` bindings are now optional with
this release. It was already possible to compile the cairo C library without
them but the bindings assumed these features to always exist.

If you make use of these features you now need to enable them when depending
on the `cairo` crate.

### GDBus

GLib comes with its own
[DBus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) IPC implementation.
Starting with this release big parts of the API are included in the bindings
and it is for example possible to create DBus services or use existing DBus
services.

The API is very close to the C API and as such not very convenient to use yet,
but more convenient APIs can be built on top of this in external crates or
maybe in future versions of the bindings. More to see later!

### No more `Widget::destroy()`

The `gtk::Widget::destroy()` function is marked as `unsafe` starting from this
release. Calling it on arbitrary widgets can cause all kinds of negative
side-effects and should be prevented.

Most usages of `destroy()` were related to dialogs or other windows. Instead
of `destroy()` the safer `close()` can be used now, which also allows the
window to handle the event.

### More subclassing support in `gtk`

This new release features subclassing support for many additional types:
IconView, CellRenderers (Pixbuf, Text, Spinner, Progress, Toggle, Accel,
Combo, Spin), DrawingArea, Plug, Socket and Fixed.

Together with all the ones that existed in previous releases, the most
commonly used types in GTK where subclassing is useful should be covered.
If some are missing, please open issues so we can add them.

### Conclusion

This release took us a lot of time but as you can see, it was definitely
worth it. We expect to provide even more tools to make gtk-rs development
as fun as possible and to continue to improve the bindings. More to come
soon!
